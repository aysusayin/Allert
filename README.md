# Allert
Allert is an app where you look up for medicine's ingredients before you use it and see if it contains a material that you are allergic to.

To use this app you have to create a profile and add the materials that you are allergic to. After that you can start using it! All you have to do is to search for the drug that you are going to take. App will give a warning message if the drug contains a material that you are allergic to. You can also add that drug into your favorites list or blacklist.

The application is in Turkish language but the English version will be released soon. Also there will be updates which will include following changes:
- Barcode reading mechanism will be added.
- Trusted People: User can other add users that they know as "trusted person" and share his/her information.
- Food and other products will be added.
